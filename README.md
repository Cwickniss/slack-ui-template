# Slack UI Template
Quickly mock up your Slack interactions with attachments and message formatting in Sketch!

## The basics
This UI template is intended to cover all the basic Slack message formatting and, more importantly, attachments currently found in [Slackâ€™s API documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments).

Since the basic attachment layout is based around a 400px wide attachment presentation size, this basic column is roughly 420px (including message border, padding, etc.)

Symbols and text styles were used copiously! Very open to suggestions on more effective ways to organize the folder / layer structure.

## Todo
Lots to come, but next big update will include [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/) (i.e. *the Slack typeface*), and possibly mobile layouts.
