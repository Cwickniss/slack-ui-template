## The basics
This UI template is intended to cover all the basic Slack message formatting, attachment types, and interactive messages currently found in [Slack’s API documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments).

Since the basic attachment layout is based around a 400px wide attachment presentation size, the column layout out this template is roughly 462px (including message border, padding, etc.)

Symbols and text styles were used copiously!

## Todo
- Mobile layouts
- `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
